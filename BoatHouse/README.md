![ALT TEXT](http://i58.tinypic.com/2vxepaq.png)
This is the code to change the year when published, so that it is stored in iSENSE for the same year as the year for data comparison. (The year you want it published as can be selected in the settings screen.)

![ALT TEXT](http://i62.tinypic.com/kbbzts.png)
This code is different from the other screens, since the other screens can simply return the thumbposition for the result. The code had to be sperated because of the large scale for nitrates, and is accurate to the nearest .5 from 0 to 10 mg/L, and then to the nearest 5 from 10 to 50 mg/L.

To publish to iSENSE, (which is available from the moment the table submits a data value for each of the 4 categories) you need to have the iSENSE invisible component.
