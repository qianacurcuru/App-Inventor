# Power to Production

This is the first prototpe for the Power to Production app. There are no known issues or bugs with the app. This description will remain vague until we have observed its use in the field trip environment, as we might be making any number of changes after the Tsongas History Center has used/reviewed it.

New changes made to app.  Now uploads to project 1235, instead of project 1160. Graphs of students' data are now available within the app, and the save button is dimmed until the students have input all 4 data points on each screen.
